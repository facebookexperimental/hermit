/// Repeat a run multiple times in a controlled search to find concurrency bugs.
///
/// Hermit analyze searches over runs of `hermit run`, and its primary input is a set of CLI flags
/// that constitute a hermit run, i.e., ARGS in `hermit run ARGS`.  These arguments are passed to
/// all runs that analyze considers (but some options may be overwritten by the settings varied by
/// analyze's search process).
///
/// The analyzer is interested in programs with some *target* property (such as non-zero exit code
/// due to crashing).  Analyze must have, or find, a `hermit run` execution that exhibits this
/// target property. If the target "run1" is not explicitly provided, the tool can search for it
/// (--search).
///
/// Analyze must also have a second (baseline) one that does not. If a "run2" is not provided,
/// analyze assumes that a hermit run without chaos is the baseline.
///
/// Finally, given a target and a baseline run, the job of analyze is to search between them and
/// find the critical events: instructions which, when reordered, cause the target property to hold
/// or not.  This is evidence of an order violation or race condition bug, and means the the program
/// has at least one concurrency bug.
///
/// The critical events are identified to the user by printing their stack traces, optionally into a
/// separate report file.
