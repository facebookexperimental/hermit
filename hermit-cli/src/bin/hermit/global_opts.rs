/// Hermit provides a sandbox for deterministic and reproducible execution.

/// environment.

/// See the "run" and "record" subcommands to run programs within hermit.
/// In both modes, the host file system is visible
/// to the command run inside hermit, and the results will depend on the contents
/// (but not timestamps or inode numbers) of those inputs.
///
/// In run mode, networking is disallowed.  Run mode guarantees that if you
/// run twice with the same input files, you will receive bitwise identical
/// outputs from the computation.
///
/// In record mode, inputs (both files and network traffic) are captured
/// in a content addressible store (CAS).  In this preview version of
/// hermit, the CAS is stored locally in your home directory (~/.hermit).
