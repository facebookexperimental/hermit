//! `mmap` is a tricky case. When using `MAP_ANONYMOUS` with a file descriptor of
//! -1, we are effectively allocating memory. If ASLR is turned off, this should
//! be deterministic and the mmap can be let through in this case. However, when
//! mapping a file descriptor, things get tricky. Memory writes from one thread
//! can affect the memory reads from another thread. During recording, we should
//! record the entire contents of the buffer. During replay, we need some way to
//! allocate the same size buffer at the same address. We do this by injecting
//!
//! ```ignore
//! mmap(desired_addr, length, flags | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0)
//! ```
//!
//! in order to get a blank memory map of the right size. We can then fill this
//! with the previously recorded bytes.
