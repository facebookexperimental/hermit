NOTE [Blocking Syscalls via Internal Polling]
---------------------------------------------

A system like hermit which sequentializes execution must have the ability to detect
blocking operations, so as not to deadlock the system. (This remains true irrespective of
whether sequentialization is relaxed to admit some parallelism.)

One option is for hermit to *precisely* model everything that may cause a syscall to
block, and run the syscall only when it is certain that it can complete.  This is the
approach with the precise implementation of futexes, for example, but it is tricky in
general and requires hermit recapitulate a lot of the logic in the Linux kernel.

Hence the need for this quick-and-dirty alternative of polling for internal blocking
operations. The idea is that many potentially-blocking syscalls have the option to be run
in a non-blocking fashion. This concept is captured by the `NonBlockableSyscall` trait.

The way the polling strategy works is that the handler inside the guest converts the
syscall to its nonblocking form (or ensures it runs nonblocking via file descriptor
configuration).  The handler executes the syscall in a loop, while increasing the
`poll_attempt` to make it visible to the scheduler that these are retries of a [logically]
blocking operation, rather than new operations.

The scheduler can then interleave these polling operations into the deterministic
linearization of all guest side effects, just like any other operations.  However, it is a
good idea to have some form of "backoff" when polling, because this strategy can
asymptotically increase the total number of syscalls performed. For example, there are a
large number of threads polling, and one thread productively running, we don't want to
poll every thread once for every step of productive work. Conversely, we want to guarantee
that no poller is starved indefinitely, because that could lead to live lock in the
presence of any kind of "busy waiting".

Determinism And linearization assumptions
-----------------------------------------

Why is this strategy deterministic?  How can we guarantee that on two separate executions,
the same syscall `S` will retry exactly `N` times at times `T_1 ... T_n`?

The assumption we make here is that all syscalls, even across multiple cores, act as
atomic operations on the kernel state --- from the guest's perspective.  That is, halfway
through executing a guest, we can describe the prior history of system as the linear
series of syscalls committed to the kernel. Does this actually hold for Linux?  It doesn't
seem to be documented anywhere, and Linux doesn't have anything like a formal semantics.
For most syscalls we treat their man pages as the spec, and they don't answer questions
like this.

If we execute a guest entirely on one core, then only a weaker form of the assumption
needs to hold.

The upshot is, because we make this "linearizability of syscalls" assumption, each polling
attempt for a given syscall is assumed to deterministically succeed or fail based on the
history of syscalls that committed before it.

The troublesome race
--------------------

One may wonder why not simply implement polling by *letting* the operation block,
backgrounding the thread, and then checking in at each polling point to see if the
operation has completed *without* incurring a user/kernel context switch and executing the
syscall again. This would indeed be great, but it would require an oracle that can answer
the question: "has thread X unblocked yet"?

### A non-solution dead-end:

We can recapture control flow immediately after any blocking syscall (in the handler), but
that "posthook" won't run until (1) the syscall unblocks, and (2) the OS gets around to
actually scheduling the thread.  Thus, inside the scheduler, we are racing with threads
like this that are unblocked and in the process of attempting to report for duty.  Such
threads can signal their readiness by tweaking the scheduler data structures, but those
updates arrive completely asynchronously.  For example, if a syscall unblocks on scheduler
turn 100 in one run, how can we know it won't arrive late at turn 101 on the next run?  We
can't determinize the point that the formerly-blocked thread rejoins the scheduler pool.
Not unless we do some huge (realtime) wait at each scheduler turn to ensure the OS has had
a chance to run any recently-unblocked threads!

### Future work: efficient oracle

This nondeterministic-rejoining-the-pool strategy is exactly what we do for *externally*
blocked syscalls.  But for internally-blocked ones that we want to determinize, then we
would need a more efficient "has-unblocked?" oracle.  For example, if we had a kernel
module exposing a safe predicate function that reveals this information to userspace. It's
possible that the /proc file system exposes enough information to synchronously poll a
threads status.

But solving this may be extremely difficult, or impossible.  If the syscall that ran
before us unblocked a thread, how long does that status update take to propogate through
the kernel itself?  If one futex wake syscall unblocks 1000 other threads, their status
would have to atomically change immediately by the time the futex wake returns to the
guest, or at least by the start of the next syscall (or oracle call).

This atomicity property seems hard to guarantee for the OS. Instead, the current polling
strategy that uses nonblocking syscalls is much more localized.  It doesn't treat the
kernel state as monolithic and require atomic updates from the guest perspective, but
rather it only requires atomic treatment of whatever state is relevant to syscalls
operating on that individual resource (futex, file descriptor etc) --- a much less
stringent requirement.
