/// NOTE [Event Semantics]
///
/// The observable operations that happen on a guest thread.
///
/// Each Op event has a beginning and an end, containing an interval of zero or more instructions
/// inbetween. Each beginning and end point in time can be thought of as an imaginary marker between
/// two instructions.  Start/end RIP values, if present in the containing `SchedEvent`, correspond
/// to those beginning/end points and always point to the *next* instruction to execute.
///
/// If we speak of an event as an instantaneous thing, we're usually thinking of it as its end
/// marker. Which is as follows for each:
///
/// - Branches: after the  branch instruction has retired
/// - Syscall prehooks: just before the syscall instruction, after whatever came before
/// - Syscall posthooks: just after the syscall instruction completes
/// - Rdtsc/Cpuid: just after the designated instruction
/// - OtherInstructions: just after the region of zero or more branch-free, non-interceptable
///   instructions.
/// - SignalReceived: just after the last regular, pre-signal guest instruction, and just before the
///   first instruction of the signal handler.
///
/// If we view each event as a series of instructions contained between its start/end markers, then
/// the pattern of instructions for each would be as follows.  Here we use simple regular
/// expressions with "B" standing for branch instructions, "S" for syscall instructions, "R" for
/// RDTSC, "C" for CPUID, and "O" for all other instructions.
///
/// - Branch "O*B"
/// - Syscall prehook: ""
/// - Syscall posthook: "S"
/// - Rdtsc: "R"
/// - Cpuid: "C"
/// - OtherInstructions: "O*"
/// - SignalReceived: ""
///
/// A few observations about the above:
///
/// - Some events always correspond to zero instructions.
/// - OtherInstructions are omnipresent "dark matter" that we cannot intercept or count, so are
///   implicitly present between other events.
/// - Therefore the OtherInstructions event itself is only interesting insofar as it signals the
///   absence of other events.
/// - Branches include an implicit prefix of OtherInstructions.  This is because for a branch count
///   > 1 to make sense, we need to include the full between-branches O's: "..BO*B..". We could
///   change this design by going to either extreme. (1) removing implicit O's and changing the
///   count mechanism to allow repetition of entire sequences "(O*B)^3" instead of "B^3".  Or (2),
///   including implicit O's in all event types, and not recording them explicitly.
